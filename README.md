## Regenerating the analysis
Clone this repository and ensure that `paper_audit.xlsx` is in the same directory as `paper_analysis.Rmd`. Open `paper_analysis.Rmd` in Rstudio and run the entire script. You may be asked to create folders for storing files of figures/tables. 

You may need to install additional R packages prior to running the script.
